<p><strong>Timely return of a Loan Makes it Easier to Borrow a Second
Time</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This is the idea and realization of the big assignment of data
science and data analysis.</p>
<p>Our selected topics are：<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/leaderboard"
class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/leaderboard</a></p>
<p>We all know that loans have been a very important part in the lives
of a vast majority of people since the introduction of money over the
barter system. People have different motivations behind applying for a
loan : somebody may want to buy a house, buy a car or two-wheeler or
even start a business, or a personal loan. The ‘Lack of Money’ is a
massive assumption that people make why somebody applies for a loan,
whereas multiple researches suggest that this is not the case. Even
wealthy people prefer taking loans over spending liquid cash so as to
make sure that they have enough reserve funds for emergency needs.
Another massive incentive is the Tax Benefits that come with some
loans.</p>
<p>Note that loans are as important to lenders as they are for
borrowers. The income itself of any lending financial institution is the
difference between the high interest rates of loans and the
comparatively much lower interests on the interest rates offered on the
investors accounts. One obvious fact in this is that the lenders make
profit only when a particular loan is repaid, and is not delinquent.
When a borrower doesn’t repay a loan for more than a certain number of
days, the lending institution considers that loan to be Written-Off.
This basically means that even though the bank tries its best to carry
out loan recoveries, it doesn’t expect the loan to be repaid anymore,
and these are now termed as ‘Non-Performing Assets’ (NPAs). Eg : In case
of the Home Loans, a common assumption is that loans that are delinquent
above 720 days are written off, and they are not considered a part of
the active portfolio size.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this series of blogs, we will try to build a Machine
Learning Solution that is going to predict the probability of an
applicant repaying a loan given a set of features or columns in our
dataset : We will cover the journey from understanding the Business
Problem to carrying out the ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’, followed by
preprocessing, feature engineering, modelling, and deployment to the
local machine. I know, I know, it’s a lot of stuff and given the size
and complexity of our datasets coming from multiple tables, it is going
to take a while. So please stick with me till the end. ;)</p>
<h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent
credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken
advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.</p>
<p>Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked
population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In
order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan
experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative
data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their
clients' repayment abilities.</p>
<p>While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine
learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers
to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will
ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans
are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will
empower their clients to be successful.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a massive problem to many banks and financial
institutions, and this is the reason why these institutions are
extremely selective in rolling out loans : A vast majority of the loan
applications are rejected. This is primarily because of insufficient or
non-existent credit histories of the applicant, who are consequently
forced to turn to untrustworthy lenders for their financial needs, and
are at the risk of being taken advantage of, mostly with unreasonably
high rates of interest.</p>
<p>In order to address this issue, ‘Home Credit’ uses a lot of data
(including both Telco Data as well as Transactional Data) to predict the
loan repayment abilities of the applicants. If an applicant is deemed
fit to repay a loan, his application is accepted, and it is rejected
otherwise. This will ensure that the applicants having the capability of
loan repayment do not have their applications rejected.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to deal with such kind of issues, we are trying
to come up with a system through which a lending institution can come up
with a way to estimate the loan repayment ability of a borrower, and at
the end making this a win-win situation for everybody.</p>
<p>Can you predict each applicant's ability to repay the loan? Many
people have difficulty obtaining loans due to inadequate or non-existent
credit histories. And, unfortunately, these people are often taken
advantage of by unreliable lenders, such as loan sharks and school
loans.</p>
<p>Gitzo strives to expand financial inclusion for the unbanked
population. To ensure that these underserved populations have a positive
lending experience, Gitzo uses a variety of proxy data (including
telecommunications and transaction information) to predict a customer's
ability to repay.</p>
<p>Home Credit Gitzo is currently using a variety of statistical and
machine learning methods to make these predictions to help them unlock
the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that customers
who are able to repay their loans are not denied and that the principal
amount, maturity date and repayment calendar of the loan will enable
their customers to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="data-set-description">Data set description</h2>
<p>A massive problem when it comes to obtaining financial datasets are
the security concerns that arise with sharing them on a public platform.
However, in order to motivate machine learning practitioners to come up
with innovative techniques to build a predictive model, all of us should
be really thankful to ‘Home Credit’ because collecting data of such
variance is not an easy task. ‘Home Credit’ has done wonders over here
and provided us with a dataset that is thorough and pretty clean.</p>
<p>‘Home Credit’ Group is a 24 year old lending agency (founded in 1997)
that provides Consumer Loans to its customers, and has operations in 9
countries in total. They entered the Indian Market in 2012 and have
served more than 10 Million Consumers in the country. In order to
motivate ML Engineers to construct efficient models, they have devised a
Kaggle Competition for the same task. <strong>Their motto is to empower
undeserved customers (by which they mean customers with little or no
credit history present) by enabling them to borrow both easily as well
as safely, both online as well as offline.</strong></p>
<p>Note that the dataset that has been shared with us is very
comprehensive and contains a lot of information about the borrowers. The
data is segregated in multiple text files that are related to each other
such as in the case of a Relational Database. The datasets contain
extensive features such as the type of loan, gender, occupation as well
as income of the applicant, whether he/she owns a car or real estate, to
name a few. It also consists of the past credit history of the
applicant.</p>
<p>We have a column called ‘SK_ID_CURR’, which acts as the input that we
take to make the default predictions, and our problem at hand is a
‘Binary Classification Problem’, because given the Applicant’s
‘SK_ID_CURR’ (present ID), our task is to predict 1 (if we think our
applicant is a defaulter), and 0 (if we think our applicant is not a
defaulter).</p>
<p><strong>application_{train|test}.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the main table, broken into two files for Train (with
TARGET) and Test (without TARGET).</li>
<li>Static data for all applications. One row represents one loan in our
data sample.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>bureau.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All client's previous credits provided by other financial
institutions that were reported to Credit Bureau (for clients who have a
loan in our sample).</li>
<li>For every loan in our sample, there are as many rows as number of
credits the client had in Credit Bureau before the application
date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>bureau_balance.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly balances of previous credits in Credit Bureau.</li>
<li>This table has one row for each month of history of every previous
credit reported to Credit Bureau – i.e the table has (#loans in sample *
# of relative previous credits * # of months where we have some history
observable for the previous credits) rows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>POS_CASH_balance.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly balance snapshots of previous POS (point of sales) and cash
loans that the applicant had with Home Credit.</li>
<li>This table has one row for each month of history of every previous
credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to loans
in our sample – i.e. the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative
previous credits * # of months in which we have some history observable
for the previous credits) rows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>credit_card_balance.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards that the
applicant has with Home Credit.</li>
<li>This table has one row for each month of history of every previous
credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to loans
in our sample – i.e. the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative
previous credit cards * # of months where we have some history
observable for the previous credit card) rows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>previous_application.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All previous applications for Home Credit loans of clients who have
loans in our sample.</li>
<li>There is one row for each previous application related to loans in
our data sample.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>installments_payments.csv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Repayment history for the previously disbursed credits in Home
Credit related to the loans in our sample.</li>
<li>There is a) one row for every payment that was made plus b) one row
each for missed payment.</li>
<li>One row is equivalent to one payment of one installment OR one
installment corresponding to one payment of one previous Home Credit
credit related to loans in our sample.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Negative Class(0) refers to Non- Defaulters whereas the
Positive Class (1) refers to the Defaulters in the dataset.</em></p>
<p>Our Dataset schema looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/image/Home-Credit-Default-Risk/hcdr-01.png" /></p>
<p>As we can see from above, we have a total of 8 datasets in total.</p>
<h2 id="needs-and-objectives">Needs and Objectives</h2>
<p>Now, since we have understood the Datasets as well as the task at
hand, we need to be able to identify the associated business objectives
and constraints for the problem at hand. This is extremely important
before we move forward, because this would determine the kind of
solution that we need to develop.</p>
<p>The objective or our task at hand is to identify the potential
defaulters based on the data given about the applicants. We can, of
course, create new features on top of the existing features.</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretability is Important</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that we should be able to generate the Probability
Estimates, of an applicant being capable or not capable of repayment of
a loan, rather than strictly classifying the applicant as either of
them. However, interpretability of the model is not as important as in
the case of Medical Applications like Cancer Diagnosis.</p>
<p>Eg: If probability is 0.5 for an applicant’s capability and 0.9 in
the other case, we can very well conclude that we are much more sure of
the capability when the value is 0.9 (and classified as 1) rather than
when the value is 0.5 (and then classified as 1).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Misclassification Cost</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very important real world metric that needs to be
considered because our cost of misclassification can be very high.</p>
<p>If a loan applicant who is not capable of loan repayment is
classified as capable and he/she is granted a loan, and in case he/she
is unable to repay the loan, the bank or financial institution runs into
delinquencies and may suffer losses, which could even have to be Written
Off.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a capable applicant is classified as non-capable, the
person has his/her application rejected and the Bank loses out on a
customer, which affects their profits.</p>
<h2 id="problem-analysis">Problem Analysis</h2>
<p>We can formulate the Machine Learning Problem, which would adhere to
the objectives and constraints that we have defined.</p>
<p>The dataset that we have has both the features as well as the class
label (Target), and we have to predict the corresponding class labels (0
or 1). This basically means that this is a Supervised Learning Binary
Classification Problem.</p>
<p>When we carry out the Exploratory Data Analysis, we will be able to
see that our dataset is highly imbalanced, which means that we have to
take this imbalance into account while we decide the performance metric
that we are going to use.</p>
<h3 id="performance-metrics">Performance Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>ROC_AUC Score :</strong> In this particular Kaggle
Competition, note that the ROC_AUC Score is the performance metric that
has been chosen to be optimised by the organisers. An ROC Curve is
insensitive to class imbalance and the ROC Curve is the most commonly
used method to visualise the performance of a Binary Classifier
(plotting for the <em>True Positive Rate</em> and <em>False Positive
Rate</em> Values for a particular threshold). The ROC_AUC Score is one
of the best ways to summarise the model performance in a single number.
The higher this score, better is the model performance. T<em>his is
going to be our primary performance metric in this case study.</em></p>
<p><strong>Confusion Matrix :</strong> A Confusion Matrix can be
constructed on both the Binary as well as Multi-class classification
scenarios, and is a very good visual representation to get an overview
of all the predictions made on a particular class by a model. It
accurately shows the correct classifications as well as the
misclassifications made by a model.</p>
<p><img src="/image/Home-Credit-Default-Risk/hcdr-02.webp" /></p>
<p>We want to maximise the number of datapoints belonging to the Blue
cells, and minimise the number of datapoints that are belonging to the
Red cells.</p>
<p><em>Now, with the help of the Confusion Matrix, we can also take a
look at a couple of more performance metrics, which will be now much
easier to visualise.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Precision Score :</strong> The Precision Score is defined as
the ratio of True Positives (that are predicted by the model) and the
total number of actual positives. The total number of actual positives
is the summation of TP and FP (ie. Column 2) in the above Confusion
Matrix Diagram.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/image/Home-Credit-Default-Risk/hcdr-03.webp" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recall Score :</strong> The Recall Score is defined as the
ratio of True Positives and the Actual Positives for a model. The total
number of actual positives is the summation of TP and FN (ie. Row 2) in
the above Confusion Matrix Diagram.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to remember another important fact that we want to
minimise the number of False Negatives in our prediction, which means
people who actually are defaulters and we are predicting them to be
non-defaulters. This is a business need because the cost of making such
an error could be very high to the bank:- the probability of delinquency
will increase. On the other hand, the number of False Positives is of
much lesser significance : Even if a Non-Defaulter is predicted by the
model to be a defaulter, it mostly will not lead to huge business loss
for the bank, since the applicant can reapply, and could receive a loan
after human interference.</p>

<h3 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<p><em>In statistics,</em> <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>
<em>is an approach of analysing datasets to summarise their main
characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data
visualisation methods.</em></p>
<p>Note that ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ is one of the most important
and critical parts of the Machine Learning pipeline : Without
understanding of the data, we would not be able to make sense of the
data, preprocess the data if needed, make a strategy to deal with
missing values and outliers, and thus affecting our model prediction.
Even though Feature Engineering is the core of a Machine Learning Model,
EDA is underrated and its importance is undermined by a vast
majority.</p>
<p>Here, we create a data preprocessing class and construct some more
useful class functions to help us further preprocess the data:</p>

<p>From this, we would be able to appreciate the sense of how
comprehensive the data is, and how it contains hundreds of raw features.
The main train and test datasets are the
<em>‘application_train.csv’</em> and the
<em>‘application_test.csv’</em>, which contain the applicant information
for the clients who have applied for the loan at present. As we have
seen in the dataset schema, the column ‘SK_ID_CURR’ acts as the foreign
key in the other dataset tables. We are going to use this column to

<p>We previously said that our dataset is highly imbalanced and now we
have the proof of that. Of all the rows present in the Training dataset,
note that only 8.07% of the records are defaulters (class label 1), and
the remaining 91.92% of the records correspond to non-defaulters (class
label 0). This is the reason why we choose a metric like ROC_AUC Score,
which does not get impacted by this data imbalance.</p>
<p>Followed by this, we are defining a couple of functions to construct
the stacked Bar plots:</p>

<p>We then use this function to plot the classification graph to obtain
the split of the categorical column’s dimensions and any relevance, if
present to the applicant being a defaulter or not.</p>
